title: New year, new Downing class
---

First week with my new Downing class and I have started to remember why I decided to take Downing for a second time. Even though his classes are tough, they are very rewarding to those who put the effort into it. I had such a great time with CS 371P (Object Oriented Programming) that I wished to take it a second time only to be sure that I took in all the information Downing was raining upon us. And now with this class I feel it is going to be the same way. I was skeptical at first about the 5-man projects written on python, but after considering it for a while I cannot think of a better way to show how modern programming teams work by sharing code and assigning small tasks to individual members.

Now that the syllabus week is over, I am planning on getting ahead and finish the project ahead of time so that I don't get caught off-guard by the Friday deadline and end up with many projects, homeworks, and assigments all piled up on a single day. Lets hope this class goes great like all my other CS classes.
