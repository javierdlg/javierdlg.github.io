title: Collatz Dragon SLAYED - Week 1
---
You heard that right! The collatz project due on Thursday is done! Quite the experience since this is my first big python project. At first I was skeptical about python since I've seen it as a very innefficient language. But now that I've played with it for a while I must admit that it really cuts down development time. By the end of the project my biggest problem was remembering to add the ":" at the end of my if and for loops. Nevertheless, I am glad I decided to take CS 373 eventhough it's in Python.

This week I have been getting used to my schedule and the hard classes I'm taking this semester. Physics, Geology, Software Engineering, and Data Mining are not the best classes to pair up in one semester since they are reknown for their heavy workload. Even so, I believe that if I manage my time correcly I'll survive most of my classes. But so far I've survived the first 2 weeks so I should be on track.

Right now my biggest issues are learning Python for CS 373 and learning Java for Intro to Computer Security. Having coded in C/C++/C# all my life this will not be an easy task. It's almost as if I were learning Italian and German at the same time, which means that I'll most likely confuse the two while working.

And for the upcoming week I am planning on getting more familiar with Python and Java. Since I dont have the collatz project looming over my head I can take it more slowly and understand the concepts more in-depth.

#####Tip of the week:
Downing provides an awesome website with a python cheat sheet called [Learn X in Y minutes, Where X = python3](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/). I'll definitely be looking at this website more often!
