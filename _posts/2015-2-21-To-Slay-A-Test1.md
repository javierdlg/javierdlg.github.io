title: To Slay a Test - Week 5
---
After Finishing the Netflix Project I tried to make it more efficient by using standard deviations to scale the offset of the averages, but I found this task too time consuming and I felt I wasn't going anywhere. There was the other option of predicting using the year the movie was released but I felt it wasn't really worth it with other projects looming over me and tests right around the corner. I took the 0.97 RMSE and turned in the project on Thursday. So far, I've been loving the class and I cant emphasize how important it is to not miss any class. Miss one and you are way behind the rest. 

This week we obviously learned how to make the project better during class and I am starting to believe that the closer you are to the due date for projects, the more downing tells you on how to solve it. I may try calling him at 9pm on Thursday and ask him about the projects in hope that he just tells me how to solve it. One may only hope...

Now that we have a test incoming I am more fearful than ever. Exams are the bane of my existence. I try my hardest but I just cant get them right. Hopefully this time around I will do better than last semester. But for now I have to concentrate, sit down, and push all the code I can into my brain in 4 days. Should be easy enough, eh?

#####Tip of the week:
Tests are literally coding problems where small details can slip through. I always recommend taking notes of the small things Downing says in class.
