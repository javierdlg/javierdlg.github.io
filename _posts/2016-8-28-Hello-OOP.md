title: New year, another Downing class - Week 1
---

* What did you do this past week?

This past week was the start of the semester. Since this is my last semester at UT I plan to graduate with flying colors and get the best grades I can. I feel that I am using this last semester as evidence that I am ready to go out and start working and living an adult life. Even so, this past week has been pretty relaxed, as it always is the first week in the semester. Taking Physics, OOP, and government together might prove difficult but not impossible and I plan on giving this semester by 100% attention.

* What's in your way?

As far as this week goes, the only obstacle I have every day is my alarm clock and by stove that loves burning my eggs every morning.

* What will you do next week?

Next week is when the actual classes start. This will be the critical point where I switch gears from summer vacation to school work. It will be hard to break old lazy habits, but I am sure I can do this. I will prepare myself for the upcoming week by working on the projects starting today, and always reading the chapters/articles specified by the professors as I feel they found great value in such things. 


This semester will prove to be the hardest yet since I have no more second chances and no do-overs. Yet, I am confident I can at least pass all my classes although I will be aiming to the elusive A.

This week's class experience was pretty cool. Since I have taken Downing's class before I know what to expect, but I found it satisfying to also help other students understand how the class works and what to expect from Downing.

##### Tip of the week:
Who doesn't love hacking? Or at least the idea that goes behind hacking. I found this game called [Hacknet](http://store.steampowered.com/app/365450/) on Steam almost a year ago and I can honestly say its a great game that introduces people into what "hacking" really is. It may not work on real life situations, but its close to home and uses real life examples of old hacking tools as the in-game tools. Pretty awesome and I enjoyed it quite a bit.
