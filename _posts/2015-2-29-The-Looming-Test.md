title: The Looming Test - week 6
---
#####1. What did you do this past week?
This past week was relaxed for me, homework was pushed to next week and I had a lot of spare time. It is so odd to suddenly after having 2 projects and 2 exams on the same week, you get a week of no work or homework. I almost feel as if the professors have a secret meeting every week where they plan this kind of stuff. Nevertheless, it allowed me to catch up with my work with Google and AFN. I also started studying for the dreaded test. If only we could replace it with a project…

#####2. What's in your way?
Currently the biggest mountain to climb is the test. Other than that, not much is in my way currently.

#####3. What will you do next week?
Most of my time will be spent studying for the test, going over the Google doc, reading the quizzes, book chapters, and assignments. I am pretty sure downing is going to ask a few questions about the chapters/readings and another few about the assignments to filter out those who didn’t participate or work on it. I plan to start with the readings, move to the projects, then the google doc, and finally to the quizzes as a way of reviewing my knowledge. I should also make my own cheat-sheet. The point of that sheet is for you to write it out and review that you got all the material covered, otherwise if you download and print someone else’s sheet you will most likely spend precious time going over it looking for something in particular.

###Tip of the week:
Going to class is crucial. I know I already said it, but I have to say it again because its so crucial that it needs double mentions. Even a third one later on to remind you about this. Classes are the core of the class (duh) and Downing knows this and thats why he made the quizzes and persuades you so much into going to class.
