title: New year, another Downing class - Week 1
---

First week with my new Downing class and I have started to remember why I decided to take Downing for a second time. Even though his classes are tough, they are very rewarding to those who put the effort into it. I had such a great time with CS 371P (Object Oriented Programming) that I wished to take it a second time only to be sure that I took in all the information Downing was raining upon us. And now with this class I feel it is going to be the same way. I was skeptical at first about the 5-man projects written on python, but after considering it for a while I cannot think of a better way to show how modern programming teams work by sharing code and assigning small tasks to individual members. I really look forward for these projects and I hope they aren’t the same as the OOP class projects. I would love to have a new challenge and be able to show my abilities on Python in a different way I did las semester. My only preoccupation is the fact that I only have a limited knowledge of Python and of its structure, so I hope it isn’t a language too hard for me to learn.

Now that the syllabus week is over, I am planning on getting ahead and finish the project ahead of time so that I don't get caught off-guard by the Friday deadline and end up with many projects, homeworks, and assignments all piled up on a single day. I also have to watch out that I don’t do the dumb mistakes I did last year like forgetting to upload a file, submitting the wrong Git SHA, and other issues that almost cost me the class. Let’s hope this class goes great like all my other CS classes.


#####Tip of the week:
Since this class is in Python and I have a strong C++ background, I find it very important to know that you can write and run C++ programs in Python very easily by using [Ctypes](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html). These literally import C++ files as if they were part of the code. Very useful and usually don't have negative performance on the program (unless it's smaller than the overhead)
