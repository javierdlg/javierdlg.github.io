title: Over the Mountain - Week 7
---
#####1. What did you do this past week?
This week I have been cramming for the test. Since tests are my kriptonite I had to dedicate most of my effor to it. Although the test was hard and the studying hours long, I believe to have done well. Otherwise I will have to tackle the next test differently. But for the most part I am not too worried since I am doing great on the projects and quizzes so my chances of getting a lettergrade down is low. Other than that I haven't been up to much.

#####2. What's in your way?
Currently, 2 other tests are in my way for the upcomming week. 

#####3. What will you do next week?
Since I have 2 CS related tests coming up I will dedicate most of my efforts to that. And besides the tests I have the upcoming spring break that I will be using to work on the upcoming SWE project if it gets released before the break. Since I have no idea what to expect from the project I want to have ample time to digest it and tackle it effectively.

###Tip of the week:
UT has a partnership with the educational website [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/) which contains thousands of videos and courses that teach a wide variety of topics. I have personally taken a few and they are incredibly informative. Just go to the website, click log in, and select "Organization login" to sign in with your UT ID. Recommended before you graduate!
