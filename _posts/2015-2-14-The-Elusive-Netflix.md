title: The Elusive Netflix - Week 4
---
This week was a tough one. My first project that was programmed in Java (ever) for Intro to Computer Security, Geology midterm, and missing the weekend and Monday because I was out of the country. Pretty much I had no time to work on the Netflix project for the entire week until Saturday, and boy did I work on it. I sat down at 10am, stared at the description, read piazza posts, went through tests other people made, read articles about the solution (or possible solutions), and then finally I started to grasp what the project was about. My partner arrived (great guy btw) and he explained it a bit further. 

The only problem was that we had no idea how to start.

So, there we are. We know what we want, but have no idea how to build it as efficient as we can since we require an RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of less than 1.0. Then, my partner had a great idea. How about we create our tests and then we build our functions to pass those tests? This was the best idea yet. We got working and in a few hours we had a working project that passed all tests (Except some corner cases). So now we got a RMSE of 1.017 and we are so close to finishing the project but we were so burned out by 7pm. We decided to call it a day and we plan on meeting on Monday and Wednesday in hopes of finishing the project in time. 

Hopefully we will get an RMSE of less than 0.856 and get $50,000 from Netflix by Thursday.

#####Tip of the week:
So I missed a very important lesson from Downing. These projects are supposed to be build to pass tests. In other words, you build the tests you need to pass and then you write the code for these tests. Also, write the simplest solution that returns the right answer (no matter how simple or dumb it is) and work your way up from there. Its a waste of time to build this incredible program and have no idea if it works correctly.
